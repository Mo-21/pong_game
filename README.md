# Pong Game

This is a simple implementation of a Ping Pong game using Python and the Turtle module. The game provides a basic interface where two players can control paddles to bounce a ball back and forth. The objective is to prevent the ball from hitting the walls behind the paddles. It implements OOP with class inheritance to ensure encapsulation and reuse.

## Gameplay
- Player 1 controls the left paddle using the 'W' and 'S' keys. 
- Player 2 controls the right paddle using the 'Up' and 'Down' arrow keys. 
- The ball will start moving towards a random direction. 
- Each time the ball hits a paddle, it will bounce back. 
- If the ball hits the wall behind a paddle, the opposing player scores a point. 
- The game ends when one player reaches the set score limit (e.g., 5 points).
